If you are using the famous [Input] fonts on your MacOS,
And the character "ï£¿" (U+F8FF) looks like a funny insect,
Then this is the right tool for you.


Just run `sh DebugInputFont.sh Input_Fonts/**/*.ttf` to get them all debugged!

The debugged fonts have their filenames prefixed with "Debug-".
